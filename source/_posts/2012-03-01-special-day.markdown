Today is a big day!

3Together studio is founded. We call  Ourselves 3Together  because  we are three guys who have a same dream:

building elegant applications and coding for fun.

Let 's say goodbye to yesterday, and say hello to tomorrow.

    NSYesterday *yesterday = [[[NSYesterday] alloc] init];
    ......
    [yesterday release];
    yesterday = nil;
    NSTomorrow *tomorrow = [[[NSTomorrow] alloc] init];
    [tomorrow sayHello];

Yes, we are reborn, we are ready!
